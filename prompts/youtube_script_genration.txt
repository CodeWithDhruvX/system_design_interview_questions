I have a list of slide objects in JSON format. After each slide, I will say "yes" to move to the next one.

Please generate the YouTube script (explainer format, in a natural, conversational tone for beginner programmers in India) for each object one by one.

After completing the all slide generate End with a warm, motivational outro encouraging viewers to subscribe.

Start with the first slide. Wait for me to say "yes" before moving to the next one.
