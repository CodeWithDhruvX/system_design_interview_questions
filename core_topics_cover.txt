ChatGPT said:
Based on the comprehensive 100-topic list we've created above, it's very thorough‚Äîbut to push it toward FANG+ level completeness, here are a few valuable advanced or nuanced system design topics that are still missing or deserve more explicit mention:

‚ö†Ô∏è Missing or Underrepresented Topics (Suggested Additions)
üîÑ 101. Data Migration Strategies
Migrating large-scale data from one system/database/version to another with zero downtime.

Techniques: dual writes, backfill, shadow reads, etc.

üìä 102. Time-Series Data Design
How to design systems that handle metrics/logs (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB).

Compression, windowing, and retention strategies.

üß™ 103. A/B Testing Infrastructure
How to design systems for experiments, feature rollouts, and variant tracking.

üì¶ 104. Package/Dependency Version Management System
Design a system like npm, Maven Central, or PyPI for hosting and versioning packages.

üõ†Ô∏è 105. Feature Toggles (Flags) at Scale
Storing, evaluating, and rolling out features safely across millions of users.

üîê 106. Design a Secrets Management System
How to manage secrets (API keys, DB passwords) securely at scale (like HashiCorp Vault).

üìÅ 107. Designing Object Storage Systems
Internals of systems like Amazon S3: storage tiers, metadata indexing, and redundancy.

üîé 108. Search Autocomplete System
Designing real-time, typo-tolerant suggestions (e.g., Google, Amazon search bar).

üó∫Ô∏è 109. Location-Based Systems

Would you like me to add these 10 to your master list (making it 110)?
Or generate structured slide JSON or video scripts for each?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed‚ÄîI'm happy to assist in structuring them all.








You said:
is there any missing topic or not?


ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ Yes, Dhruv ‚Äî your list of 100 topics is already extremely comprehensive and covers all core areas of system design expected for:

Beginner to advanced engineers

FANG-level system design interviews

Real-world scalable architecture

But here's the key insight:

üîç You are not missing any critical core topics.
However, you are missing a few niche but valuable advanced topics that often appear in staff/principal-level design discussions or specialized domains.

‚úÖ Your List Covers:
Caching, Load Balancing, Sharding, Consistency ‚úÖ

Microservices, Queues, Gateways, Circuit Breakers ‚úÖ

Real-world apps: Twitter, Uber, Paytm, Netflix ‚úÖ

Security, High Availability, Scalability ‚úÖ

Kubernetes, Docker, Monitoring, CI/CD ‚úÖ

Streaming, Search, Real-time collaboration ‚úÖ

Distributed Systems patterns and algorithms ‚úÖ

üß† Optional Advanced/Niche Topics You Might Add:
Topic	Why It Matters
A/B Testing Infrastructure	For ML, product rollout, experimentation at scale
Secrets Management System	Secure storage for credentials, like Vault
Search Autocomplete System	Complex indexing and real-time suggestions
Data Migration Strategies	Live production migrations with zero downtime
Time-Series Data Systems	Needed in monitoring/IoT/logging systems
Feature Flag System at Scale	Roll out features to segments of users
Geo-Based System Design	Geo-hashing, proximity alerts, for Uber/Maps
Object Storage Internals (like S3)	Understanding durable blob storage
Task Scheduling System (like Airflow)	For managing and orchestrating workflows
Multitenancy in SaaS Design	Efficient and secure isolation for tenants

üîö Verdict:
‚úÖ No major core topic is missing.

üìà You may choose to extend with 10 more niche topics for ultra-completeness (total 110 topics).

üß† These 10 aren't mandatory for everyone, but they demonstrate deeper architectural maturity.

Would you like me to update the master topic list to 110 with these included, or generate a JSON/slide script per topic?
