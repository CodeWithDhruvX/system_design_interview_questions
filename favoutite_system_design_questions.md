### **Tips for Using This Ultimate Checklist**

1. **Prioritize Core Topics First:** Scaling, databases, architecture, and messaging.
2. **Move to Advanced Topics Gradually:** Consensus algorithms, polyglot persistence, distributed tracing.
3. **Practice Trade-offs:** Almost every advanced topic is about **“what would you choose and why?”**
4. **Draw Diagrams:** Sketching architecture is essential even for theory questions.
5. **Integrate With Practical Learning:** Many topics here directly map to exercises like designing chat apps, URL shorteners, and e-commerce systems.
